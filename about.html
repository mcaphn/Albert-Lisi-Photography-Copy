        Thereâ€™s nothing more inviting than the unlimited potential of a pure,
        raw, open road.

        I've driven across the country four times. (Yeah, I love to drive.) I've
        seen the sun set over the Utah salt flats, rendering the landscape
        alien-like under an otherworldly purple-pink glow. I've seen a blizzard
        brew and unleash fury over the painted rocks of the Nevada desert from
        miles out. I've been stranded on a mountainside in the middle of the
        Wyoming wilderness in the dead of winter and dead of night. I've seen
        the South Dakota plains transformed into wetlands after days of rain.
        I've seen fog roll off the Montana hills so thick you'd think you could
        chew it.

        I have a deep appreciation for our national parks. They are some of the
        few remaining places on Earth where light and shadow make love to reveal
        an ancient magic that is mostly long forgotten. I've spent extended time
        in Yellowstone, Yosemite, Redwoods and Badlands.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an Eagle Scout. Camping and hiking have been integral parts of my
        life since I was a kid. I've done a seven day whitewater canoe trek down
        the Allagash River. I've spent two weeks backpacking through Cimarron,
        New Mexico. I've hiked stretches of the Appalachian Trail and the
        Catskill Mountains. I've spent months under the canopies of the
        Shenandoah Valley forests. I'm at home under the stars and among the
        trees. I have a reverence for the communion man can make in nature. I
        like to leave my sites the way I find 'em.
      </p>
      <p>
        I majored in English with a concentration in Writing and a minor in
        Film. I have a visual eye, can take pretty good photos, and can tell a
        compelling story, to boot.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have eight years on-the-floor sales experience. I know how to
        communicate with - and relate to - people from all walks of life. I like
        making real connections with real people.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might be asking: no Twitter? No Insta? No YouTube? No. I don't do
        any of that. I don't derive any pleasure or benefit from using those
        services. I recognize, however, that they can be immensely powerful
        platforms for companies, businesses and nonprofits, and would be happy
        to utilize them as just that - tools of the trade.
      </p>
      <p>I love nature, I love beer, and I am awesome.</p>
